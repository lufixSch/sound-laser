## Abstract

Parametric speakers are able to transmit audible sound with a beamforming effect using ultrasonic transducers. This work will describe the development of such a speaker as well as the software necessary to operate it.

In order to build this speaker it is explained how the beamforming effect occurs and how the number of transducers as well as distance between them influences its behaviour. Furthermore non-linear acoustics and why they can demodulate amplitude or frequency modulated signals are discussed.
