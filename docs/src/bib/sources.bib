	annote = {P 271: The topic of array antennas was introduced in Sec. 3.5 with several two-element arrays as examples of simple radiating systems. Fig. 3-19 summarizes the range of pattern control that is possible by changing the spacing and phasing of two-element arrays illustrated using elements with the same excitation amplitude and isotropie patterns. Arrays are popular because of the ability to shape the pattern through spacing and excitation adjustment along with the unique capability of scanning the pattern in angular space by dynamically adjusting the excitation phases electronically. Such an array is referred to as a phased array. The traditional method of scanning a directive beam is to mechanically steer an aperture antenna such as a reflector antenna. Thus, the problem of mechanically slewing of one large antenna is traded for the feed network complexities associated with properly exciting many small antennas in an array. In addition to avoiding the need for a mechanical structure required to point a large antenna, a phased array can also scan a beam at electronic speeds and can even have multiple simultaneous main beams. Although a feed network is required to excite the array elements, today's low-cost electronics, computing, and digital signal processing hardware and software make elec- tronic scanning affordable. Arrays have the additional advantage of supporting many geometries, including non-planar surfaces to conform to existing contours such as the skin of an aircraft. There are many applications for phased arrays, most notably in radar. The first widely used array antenna was the Yagi-Uda array invented in 1926 (see Sec. 6.3). The Yagi was followed by other fixed-phase arrays that were mechanically steered. Phased arrays emerged during World War II using mechanical phase shifters. With the invention of the ferrite phase shifter in the 1950s, full electronic scanning became possible. Both array element advances and solid-state phase shifters allowed for more affordable, compact phased arrays beginning in the 1960s. The recent innovation in arrays is the active phased array in which each element has transmit/receive electronics including phase adjustment. Both arrays and aperture antennas are capable of high gain. Arrays can be analyzed using simple mathematics by summing phasors, but reflector antenna analysis requires integration over the aperture, as we will find out in the next chapter. In this chapter, we continue the development of arrays, beginning with linear arrays of multiple isotropic elements, uniform excitations, and equal spacings. The pattern of individual elements is then included. Techniques for evaluating the directivity of linear arrays are presented followed by addressing nonuniform excitation of linear arrays and multidimensional arrays. Implementation issues of mutual coupling and feeding techniques are treated. Finally, more detail is presented on the types of elements used in practical arrays along with the special topic of wide-bandwidth phased arrays.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6637767},
	abstract = {Recently, parametric loudspeakers have been utilized to reproduce an audible sound in a particular area by an ultrasound. However, parametric loudspeakers have lower sound quality than general electrodynamic loudspeakers because it is difficult to reproduce an audible sound at lower frequency. Moreover, the reproduced sound includes harmonic distortions causing deterioration of sound quality. Thus, in this paper, we attempt to improve sound quality of parametric loudspeakers. It depends on a modulation technique for designing the amplitude modulated wave. Therefore, we propose a new modulation method to reproduce audible sound with high quality. The proposed method controls a weight of double sidebands for reducing harmonic distortions at higher frequency and emphasizing power at lower frequency. We carried out evaluation experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results confirmed that the proposed method could improve sound quality of parametric loudspeakers.},

A novel method has been proposed in this paper to control the beam width of the main lobe and the level of the side lobe for the beam pattern by using an optimization technique. Furthermore, the weighting distribution of uniform linear array composed of eight transducers and the effect of different weightings on the spreading angle of the sound beam have been investigated through simulations in this study.

It equips readers with the psychoacoustical, signal processing, acoustical, and mathematical knowledge needed to understand the inner workings of modern processing utilities, special equipment for recording, manipulation, and reproduction in the higher-order Ambisonic format. The book comes with various practical examples based on free software tools and open scientific data for reproducible research. The book’s introductory section offers a perspective on Ambisonics spanning from the origins of coincident recordings in the 1930s to the Ambisonic concepts of the 1970s, as well as classical ways of applying Ambisonics in first-order coincident sound scene recording and reproduction that have been practiced since the 1980s. As, from time to time, the underlying mathematics become quite involved, but should be comprehensive without sacrificing readability, the book includes an extensive mathematical appendix. The book offers readers a deeper understanding of Ambisonic technologies, and will especially benefit scientists, audio-system and audio-recording engineers. In the advanced sections of the book, fundamentals and modern techniques as higher-order Ambisonic decoding, 3D audio effects, and higher-order recording are explained. Those techniques are shown to be suitable to supply audience areas ranging from studio-sized to hundreds of listeners, or headphone-based playback, regardless whether it is live, interactive, or studio-produced 3D audio material.},

In this review paper, we examine some of the important advances in the PAA since it was first proposed by Westervelt in 1963. These advances include theoretical modelling for the PAA, signal processing methods, design considerations and implementation issues, and applications of the PAA in underwater acoustic engineering. Moreover, we highlight some technical challenges which impede further development of the PAA, and correspondingly give a glimpse on its possible extension in the future. This article provides a comprehensive overview of some important works of the PAA and serves as a quick tutorial reference to readers who are interested to further explore and extend this technology, and bring this technology to other application areas.},

	abstract = {Similar to other therapeutic methods, ultrasound surgery requires an imaging modality to monitor the extent of tissue damage during treatment. In this paper, we have considered the method of ultrasound-stimulated acoustic emission (USAE) that uses two ultrasonic beams at high frequency (1.7 MHz) (same as that used for ablation) to locally excite the tissue by generating a low-frequency (1–50 kHz) radiation force. Recording of the tissue response at several locations yields an image. The amplitude of the tissue response depends on the mechanical and acoustic tissue properties, namely its stiffness and absorption. These two properties were initially hypothesized to have counteractive effects on the response amplitude, i.e., the amplitude should increase with absorption and decrease with stiffness. To check this hypothesis as well as the degree to which these properties influence the response, finite-element simulations of a uniform lesion formed inside a homogeneous medium were used. The results show that, as expected, the displacement amplitude decreased with increasing lesion stiffness at lower frequencies (except at resonance) while, contrary to our initial hypothesis, it increased with stiffness at relatively higher frequencies ({\textgreater}22 kHz). At resonance, a frequency upshift occurred with increasing stiffness but was found to be highly spatially variant and system dependent, i.e., not yielding a uniform lesion response when imaged. On the other hand, the absorption increase led to a uniform linear increase of the mechanical response amplitude of the lesion. Therefore, at higher frequencies, increase of the two parameters had a synergistic effect on the tissue response to the applied radiation force. This study showed that relatively higher frequencies constitute the optimal range in the use of USAE for coagulation monitoring. A preliminary experimental verification in vitro is also provided.},

	abstract = {Beam steering has been achieved using shear horizontal waves generated using a periodic permanent magnet (PPM) electromagnetic transducer (EMAT). Unlike phased arrays, where steering is achieved by carefully controlling the firing of individual elements, the spatial periodicity of the PPM EMAT is ultilised to steer the beam whilst exciting all elements simultaneously. Due to the periodic nature of the array, the interference of individual waves from each of the elements creates a highly frequency dependent angle of propagation, allowing the directivity to be changed by simply varying the frequency of the input signal. Simultaneous excitation precludes the need for complicated and expensive phased array hardware. A frequency domain model is developed so that the beam characteristics, such as steering angle and beam width, can be calculated, allowing for investigation into the beam steering qualities of the PPM transducer. Broadband pulsed generation is also demonstrated, showing how a wave is generated over a large range of angles, meaning a large area can be covered with a single pulse. Interesting properties of this wave, such as a variation of frequency as a function of angle, and how this can be useful, are also discussed.},

The model may be used, for example, as a predictive tool to improve sensor design, or to provide a noise-free response function that could be deconvolved from sound-field measurements in order to improve accuracy in high-frequency metrology and imaging applications. The specific question of whether effective element sizes as small as the optical-diffraction limit can be achieved was investigated. For a polymer film sensor with a FP cavity of thickness d, the minimum effective element radius was found to be about 0.9d, and that an illumination spot radius of less than d/4 is required to achieve it},

The excitation input signals of parametric array were designed and analyzed. A parameter array is measured under the different excitation signals. The results show that: (1) When the input signals is single-sideband amplitude modulatory signal the harmonic distortion of the sound field is relatively small compared to the double sideband amplitude modulated signal and the difference frequency wave acoustic source level is higher; (2) The difference frequency wave source level will increase rapidly with increase of input power of the parametric array. But too much power may cause the power amplifier to produce nonlinear, thus the harmonic amplitude increase and the conversion efficiency will be lower.},

	abstract = {Parametric loudspeakers have very high directivity and can be applied to various applications. In such loudspeakers, modulating the carrier waves is important because the modulated waves are demodulated into audible waves by nonlinear interaction in the air. Amplitude modulation (AM) has been proposed as the modulation method for parametric loudspeakers and frequency modulation (FM) has been empirically utilized for them. However, FM has been insufﬁciently studied because it has been considered as one type of amplitude modulation for parametric loudspeakers. In this paper, we reveal that the demodulation in AM and FM differs in a parametric loudspeaker. In addition, we propose a new modulation method based on synchronized demodulation of AM and FM. The method achieves higher sound pressure levels at lower frequencies than conventional modulation methods. Finally, we conﬁrm the method’s effectiveness through evaluation experiments.},
