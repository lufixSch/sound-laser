	annote = {P 271: The topic of array antennas was introduced in Sec. 3.5 with several two-element arrays as examples of simple radiating systems. Fig. 3-19 summarizes the range of pattern control that is possible by changing the spacing and phasing of two-element arrays illustrated using elements with the same excitation amplitude and isotropie patterns. Arrays are popular because of the ability to shape the pattern through spacing and excitation adjustment along with the unique capability of scanning the pattern in angular space by dynamically adjusting the excitation phases electronically. Such an array is referred to as a phased array. The traditional method of scanning a directive beam is to mechanically steer an aperture antenna such as a reflector antenna. Thus, the problem of mechanically slewing of one large antenna is traded for the feed network complexities associated with properly exciting many small antennas in an array. In addition to avoiding the need for a mechanical structure required to point a large antenna, a phased array can also scan a beam at electronic speeds and can even have multiple simultaneous main beams. Although a feed network is required to excite the array elements, today's low-cost electronics, computing, and digital signal processing hardware and software make elec- tronic scanning affordable. Arrays have the additional advantage of supporting many geometries, including non-planar surfaces to conform to existing contours such as the skin of an aircraft. There are many applications for phased arrays, most notably in radar. The first widely used array antenna was the Yagi-Uda array invented in 1926 (see Sec. 6.3). The Yagi was followed by other fixed-phase arrays that were mechanically steered. Phased arrays emerged during World War II using mechanical phase shifters. With the invention of the ferrite phase shifter in the 1950s, full electronic scanning became possible. Both array element advances and solid-state phase shifters allowed for more affordable, compact phased arrays beginning in the 1960s. The recent innovation in arrays is the active phased array in which each element has transmit/receive electronics including phase adjustment. Both arrays and aperture antennas are capable of high gain. Arrays can be analyzed using simple mathematics by summing phasors, but reflector antenna analysis requires integration over the aperture, as we will find out in the next chapter. In this chapter, we continue the development of arrays, beginning with linear arrays of multiple isotropic elements, uniform excitations, and equal spacings. The pattern of individual elements is then included. Techniques for evaluating the directivity of linear arrays are presented followed by addressing nonuniform excitation of linear arrays and multidimensional arrays. Implementation issues of mutual coupling and feeding techniques are treated. Finally, more detail is presented on the types of elements used in practical arrays along with the special topic of wide-bandwidth phased arrays.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6637767},
	abstract = {Recently, parametric loudspeakers have been utilized to reproduce an audible sound in a particular area by an ultrasound. However, parametric loudspeakers have lower sound quality than general electrodynamic loudspeakers because it is difficult to reproduce an audible sound at lower frequency. Moreover, the reproduced sound includes harmonic distortions causing deterioration of sound quality. Thus, in this paper, we attempt to improve sound quality of parametric loudspeakers. It depends on a modulation technique for designing the amplitude modulated wave. Therefore, we propose a new modulation method to reproduce audible sound with high quality. The proposed method controls a weight of double sidebands for reducing harmonic distortions at higher frequency and emphasizing power at lower frequency. We carried out evaluation experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results confirmed that the proposed method could improve sound quality of parametric loudspeakers.},

Based on the measurements of the sound emitted from the two parametric arrays of ultrasonic transducers the directivity of the proposed system and the interaural crosstalk characteristics are determined. The application of the system concerns creating a personal audio space for users of mobile platforms, such as notebooks, and applying 3D audio algorithms without the need of using headphones.},

A directional audible sound can be generated by amplitude-modulating the ultrasound carrier with an audio signal, then transmitting it from an array of ultrasonic transducers. A novel method has been proposed in this paper to control the beam width of the main lobe and the level of the side lobe for the beam pattern by using an optimization technique. Furthermore, the weighting distribution of uniform linear array composed of eight transducers and the effect of different weightings on the spreading angle of the sound beam have been investigated through simulations in this study. The results show that the optimization method proposed in the paper can effectively control the beam width of the main lobe and the level of the side lobe for the audible sound.},

	abstract = {This open access book provides a concise explanation of the fundamentals and background of the surround sound recording and playback technology Ambisonics. It equips readers with the psychoacoustical, signal processing, acoustical, and mathematical knowledge needed to understand the inner workings of modern processing utilities, special equipment for recording, manipulation, and reproduction in the higher-order Ambisonic format. The book comes with various practical examples based on free software tools and open scientific data for reproducible research. The book’s introductory section offers a perspective on Ambisonics spanning from the origins of coincident recordings in the 1930s to the Ambisonic concepts of the 1970s, as well as classical ways of applying Ambisonics in first-order coincident sound scene recording and reproduction that have been practiced since the 1980s. As, from time to time, the underlying mathematics become quite involved, but should be comprehensive without sacrificing readability, the book includes an extensive mathematical appendix. The book offers readers a deeper understanding of Ambisonic technologies, and will especially benefit scientists, audio-system and audio-recording engineers. In the advanced sections of the book, fundamentals and modern techniques as higher-order Ambisonic decoding, 3D audio effects, and higher-order recording are explained. Those techniques are shown to be suitable to supply audience areas ranging from studio-sized to hundreds of listeners, or headphone-based playback, regardless whether it is live, interactive, or studio-produced 3D audio material.},

Due to its predominant technical advantages, PAA has been widely used in a variety of application scenarios of underwater acoustic engineering, such as sub-bottom profile measurement, underwater acoustic communication, and detection of buried targets. In this review paper, we examine some of the important advances in the PAA since it was first proposed by Westervelt in 1963. These advances include theoretical modelling for the PAA, signal processing methods, design considerations and implementation issues, and applications of the PAA in underwater acoustic engineering. Moreover, we highlight some technical challenges which impede further development of the PAA, and correspondingly give a glimpse on its possible extension in the future. This article provides a comprehensive overview of some important works of the PAA and serves as a quick tutorial reference to readers who are interested to further explore and extend this technology, and bring this technology to other application areas.},
