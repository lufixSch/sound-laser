The topic of array antennas was introduced in Sec. 3.5 with several two-element arrays as
examples of simple radiating systems. Fig. 3-19 summarizes the range of pattern control
that is possible by changing the spacing and phasing of two-element arrays illustrated
using elements with the same excitation amplitude and isotropie patterns. Arrays are
popular because of the ability to shape the pattern through spacing and excitation
adjustment along with the unique capability of scanning the pattern in angular space by
dynamically adjusting the excitation phases electronically. Such an array is referred to as
a phased array. The traditional method of scanning a directive beam is to mechanically
steer an aperture antenna such as a reflector antenna. Thus, the problem of mechanically
slewing of one large antenna is traded for the feed network complexities associated with
properly exciting many small antennas in an array. In addition to avoiding the need for a
mechanical structure required to point a large antenna, a phased array can also scan a
beam at electronic speeds and can even have multiple simultaneous main beams.
Although a feed network is required to excite the array elements, today's low-cost
electronics, computing, and digital signal processing hardware and software make elec-
tronic scanning affordable. Arrays have the additional advantage of supporting many
geometries, including non-planar surfaces to conform to existing contours such as the
skin of an aircraft. There are many applications for phased arrays, most notably in radar.
The first widely used array antenna was the Yagi-Uda array invented in 1926 (see
Sec. 6.3). The Yagi was followed by other fixed-phase arrays that were mechanically
steered. Phased arrays emerged during World War II using mechanical phase shifters.
With the invention of the ferrite phase shifter in the 1950s, full electronic scanning
became possible. Both array element advances and solid-state phase shifters allowed for
more affordable, compact phased arrays beginning in the 1960s. The recent innovation in
arrays is the active phased array in which each element has transmit/receive electronics
including phase adjustment.
Both arrays and aperture antennas are capable of high gain. Arrays can be analyzed
using simple mathematics by summing phasors, but reflector antenna analysis requires
integration over the aperture, as we will find out in the next chapter. In this chapter, we
continue the development of arrays, beginning with linear arrays of multiple isotropic
elements, uniform excitations, and equal spacings. The pattern of individual elements is
then included. Techniques for evaluating the directivity of linear arrays are presented
followed by addressing nonuniform excitation of linear arrays and multidimensional
arrays. Implementation issues of mutual coupling and feeding techniques are treated.
Finally, more detail is presented on the types of elements used in practical arrays along
with the special topic of wide-bandwidth phased arrays.},
