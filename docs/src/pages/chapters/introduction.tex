In communications technology antenna arrays are used to increase directivity of antennas and therefore amplify their reception power in the main radiation direction.\cite{netzberger_kommunikationstechnologie_2021-2} This technology can not only be used for electromagnetic waves but any kind of wave. Parametric arrays achieve a similar beamforming effect in acoustics which is utilised in non invasive medical imaging applications\cite{novelline_squires_1997}\cite{konofagou_focused_2001} or seismic profiling\cite{muir_highresolution_1984}.\p
The aim of this thesis is to develop a speaker which generates a beam of audible sound with the use of a parametric array.
%The result of this project will not be a finished product but a prototype. Therefore no attention is given to applicable directives or standards.\p
In the following chapters the development of the speaker prototype as well as its acoustic behaviour will be explained respectively.
