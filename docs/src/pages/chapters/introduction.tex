In communications technology phased arrays are used to create a directed beam of radio waves. But this technology can not only be used for electromagnetic waves but any kind of wave. For example ultrasonic phased arrays are used for non invasive medical imaging applications.\p
The aim of this thesis is to develop a speaker wich can generate a beam of audible sound with the use of a phased array. The behaviour of the speaker will then be analyzed.\p
In the following chapters the development of this speaker from concept to prototype will be explained.
