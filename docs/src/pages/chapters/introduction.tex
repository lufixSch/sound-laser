\dots Phased arrays are used to create a directed beam of radio waves. This technology can not only be used for electromagnetic waves but any sort of wave. For example ultrasonic phased arrays are used for non invasive medical imaging applications. \dots

The aim of this thesis is to develop a speaker prototype wich can generate a beam of audible sound with the use of a phased array. The behaviour of the speaker will than be analyzed.
