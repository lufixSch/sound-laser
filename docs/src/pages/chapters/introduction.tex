In communications technology phased arrays are used to create a directed beam of radio waves. This technology can not only be used for electromagnetic waves but any kind of wave. For example ultrasonic phased arrays are used for non invasive medical imaging applications.\p
The aim of this thesis is to develop a speaker wich generates a beam of audible sound with the use of a phased array.
%The result of this project will not be a finished product but a prototype. Therefore no attention is given to applicable directives or standards.\p
In the following chapters the development of the speaker prototype as well as its acoustic behaviour will be explained respectively.
