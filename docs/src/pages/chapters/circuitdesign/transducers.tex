\section{Ultrasonic transducers}

The ultrasonic transducer chosen for this project is the CUSA-T80-15-2400-TH. It has a operating frequency of $40kHz$ and tolerates a supply voltage up to $80V$.\cite{cui_devices_cusa-t80-15-2400-th_2020}\p
One module uses $19$ transducers wich are connected in parallel as shown in figure \ref{fig:pcb:transducer_circuit}. In order to create the aspired beamforming effect the transducers are evenly distributed on the pcb (Figure \ref{fig:pcb:front}).
