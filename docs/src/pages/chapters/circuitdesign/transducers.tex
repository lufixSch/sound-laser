\section{Ultrasonic Transducers}

The ultrasonic transducer chosen for this project is the CUSA-T80-15-2400-TH. It has an operating frequency of $40\,kHz$ and tolerates a supply voltage up to $80\,V$.\cite{cui_devices_cusa-t80-15-2400-th_2020}\newpage
\noindent One module uses $19$ transducers which are connected in parallel as shown in figure \ref{fig:pcb:transducer_circuit}. In order to create the aspired beamforming effect the transducers are evenly distributed on the pcb (figure \ref{fig:pcb:front}).
