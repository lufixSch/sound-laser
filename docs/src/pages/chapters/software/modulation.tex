\subsection{Modulation}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Get Audio stream -> Queue
  \item Calculate modulation
  \subitem generate t vector
  \subitem loop
  \subitem "resample" input
  \subitem calculate modulation for one point
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Resample Signal}
%
The first problem is that the recorded audio from section \ref{sec:software:rec} has a samplingrate up to $44.1kHz$ depending on the configuration. The resulting signal however should have a samplingrate above $100kHz$. This means the signal needs to be resampled.
