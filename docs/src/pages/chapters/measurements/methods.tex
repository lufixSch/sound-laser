\subsection{Measurement setup}

The Goal of the measurements is to get an impression of the beamforming effect and compare it to the theoretical results from section \ref{sec:theory:beam}. As the DAC and the software have some problems wich could interfere with the result the testsignal is generated by a waveformgenerator. Figure \dots shows the measurement setup.\p
%
The speaker is positioned on a rotating table to measure the audio for different angles. Two microphones \dots are positioned in front and behind the speaker. This halves the number of measurements needed for a full rotation. The audio is recorded with a \dots audio interface.\p
%
AM and FM modulated sine signals with different frequencies between $0Hz$ and $20kHz$ are used to measure the behaviour of the speaker. The exact parameters are shown in table \dots.
